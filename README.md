Linear Programming Solution for Multi-Robot Task Allocations in Disaster Response

Abstract:
This repository explores using Linear Programming (LP) to optimize task allocation in multi-robot systems for disaster response. Our approach combines LP with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to adapt allocations based on real-time conditions and performance. Simulations validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.
